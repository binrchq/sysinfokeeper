                Frequently Asked Questions

Q1: Can I use it for free?
A: Yes — under AGPLv3, forever, as long as you fully comply
   (especially the network source-disclosure rule).

Q2: When do I need a commercial license?
A: You need one in any of these cases:
    • Closed-source integration or distribution
    • SaaS/cloud offering without source disclosure
    • Avoiding AGPL contamination of your codebase
    • Requiring official support, SLA, or customization

Q3: What does the AGPL "network use" clause mean?
A: If users interact with the software (or your modified 
   version) over a network, you must provide them the 
   complete source code.

Q4: Purely internal deployment (employees only) — do I 
    need to open source?
A: Generally no, as long as no external users access 
   it over the network. Consult your legal counsel for 
   certainty.

Q5: Can I evaluate under AGPLv3 first and buy commercial 
    later?
A: Absolutely. Most customers do exactly that.

Q6: What commercial licensing models are available?
A: • Annual subscription (updates + support included)
    • Perpetual license (one-time fee + optional support
      renewal)
    • OEM / embedded license
    • Unlimited enterprise license

Q7: Is prior AGPL use a problem after buying commercial?
A: The commercial license is forward-looking. We can help 
   resolve any historical compliance issues if needed.
